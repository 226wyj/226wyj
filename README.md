### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, welcome to my page.                ![visitors](https://visitor-badge.glitch.me/badge?page_id=wyj.visitor-badge)

- Iâ€™m Yuejiang Wu, a second-year MSCS student at [CIMS of NYU]([Institute | NYU Courant](https://cims.nyu.edu/dynamic/)).
- Before that, I received my B.E. degree at [Northeastern University](http://english.neu.edu.cn/), majoring in Computer Science and Technology.
- I hope to be a Software Developmer in the future, and I'm actively looking for the opportunities.
- Although I'm learning Java, Python is still my favorite.
- I like writing [blogs](https://www.jianshu.com/u/8041c26a331e) to summarize what I have learnt, unfortunately there are only Chinese articles so far.  
- In addition to coding, I also love sports and music.
